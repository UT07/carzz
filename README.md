# Getting Started with CARZ 3330 App

The UI project is made on react and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To create the backend Node.js server we use `npm init` and fill the project details when asked in package.json file.

To start the UI development server we execute `npm start`
To enable the server even after crashing we installed nodemon package which runs the server regardless of the error response. To execute the server with nodemon we used  `npx nodemon server.js` command.

The backup database can be found in [carz3330.sql]
